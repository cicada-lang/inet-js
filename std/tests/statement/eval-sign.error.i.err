[checkPortSigns] I expect the two ports to have opposite signs,
  but they all have positive sign.

  first port: !value-(sole₀)
  second port: !value-(sole₁)

[evaluate] I fail to evaluate an exp.

  exp: @connect(sole(), sole())

 1 |type Trivial
 2 |node sole(-- value!: Trivial)
 3 |
 4 |eval @connect(sole(), sole())
 5 |

[execute] I fail to execute a statement.

 1 |type Trivial
 2 |node sole(-- value!: Trivial)
 3 |
 4 |eval @connect(sole(), sole())
 5 |
