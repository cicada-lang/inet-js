[checkPortSigns] I expect the two ports to have opposite signs,
  but they all have positive sign.

  first port: (sole₁)-value!
  second port: (sole₀)-value!

[compose] I fail compose word.

  word: @connect

 1 |type Trivial -- @Type end
 2 |node sole -- Trivial :value! end
 3 |
 4 |sole sole @connect
 5 |

[Compose.execute] I fail to compose word.

  word: @connect

 1 |type Trivial -- @Type end
 2 |node sole -- Trivial :value! end
 3 |
 4 |sole sole @connect
 5 |
