[checkWords] I expect the stack to be empty after checking.

  stack length: 1
  stack: [-- ]

  Maybe this is due to extra input arity,
  or lack of output arity.

[Define.execute] I fail to define word.

  word: swapswap

 1 |claim swapswap 'A 'B -- 'B end
 2 |define swapswap @swap @swap end
 3 |
