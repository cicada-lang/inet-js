To implement this, we can not just give each edge an id,
and make them an entity in the entity store.

Because take the rule between `(zero)` and `(add)` as an example.

```
     value           value
       |               |
     (add)     =>      |
     /   \              \
(zero)   addend        addend
```

After the interaction, the path between `value` and `addend` has two edges.

To reduce this path to one edge again,
first we might think of deleting edges
and introduce new edge,
but we can not to this,
for nodes outside of the "circle"
might hold reference to the edges that we want to delete.

One way to handle this (that I can think of),
is to use `HalfEdge` instead of `Edge`,
one edge consists of two `HalfEdge`s,
each `HalfEdge` has an id.

When two edges are connected,

```
A1|A2 -- B1|B2
```

we can reduce them to one edge,

```
A1|B2
```

without effecting the references to `HalfEdge`s `A1` and `B2`.
