Due to the use of explicit barcket,
applicative syntax contains more information than concatenative syntax.

With explicit barcket, we can use auto curry.

Since applicative syntax contains more information,
we need to hold less information in our human memory.

It also does not make sense to compile to concatenative syntax,
because compilation is a kind of elaboration,
and elaboration should increase information.
