How to use inet to do practical programming?

We need to do side effects such as file IO.

- Maybe every side effects can be viewed as assignment?

We need to handle number and string.

- Maybe just view string as list of chars,
  and view char and number as special node.

- Maybe we can use special node to add number.

We need to handle JSON.

- Maybe just use association list to represent record.
